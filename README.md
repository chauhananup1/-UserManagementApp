# -UserManagementApp
This .gitignore is configured for a Spring Boot application named UserManagementApp. The project performs complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user data. It excludes common build files, IDE-specific settings, log files, and environment-specific configurations to keep the repository clean and focused on core application logic.
